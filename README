DPOW Studio
===========

This is a complete editor for manipulating DPOW files (2D graphics' layout on PES 2008+). I was planning to release this tool, sooner than later, but i was too busy to make a complete documentation for such a complex application. You may find some fairly basic informations about it on the 'Docs' folder.

Dependencies: MOrge (Graphics Preview), Ciloci FLEE (Interpolation), PESTools (zlib handling)

All needed DLLs can be found on the References folder.

It might need some tweaking on the project settings in order to compile (like DLL references update).
